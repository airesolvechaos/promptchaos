3. **Purpose & Intent** – Why is this happening now? What are the goals or motivations?
4. **Impact** – Who is affected and how (e.g., economy, society, specific groups)?
5. **Stakeholders** – Who are the most interested or influential parties?
6. **Jargon Decoder** – Explain any technical or political terms in plain English.
7. **Strategic Insights** – What are the deeper implications or “ah-ha” angles? Think like an analyst.
8. **Further Thinking** – What questions should I ask to understand the bigger picture or next steps?

Use clear section headers and bullet points where helpful. Keep the tone insightful but easy to follow.
