Task name: Daily Product Hunt Highlights

Fetch and summarize new and high-potential product launches from Product Hunt (https://www.producthunt.com/) for: today, past 3 days, past 7 days, and past 30 days.

Deliver a daily highlights briefing organized into clear sections. Prioritize products that show early signs of momentum or strategic potential. Use easy-to-understand English; you may use one-line jargon terms followed by a simple explanation.

Sections and required content:

1. Summary (1–2 sentences)
- One-sentence headline capturing the day’s biggest trend or standout product.
- One-sentence quick take on why it matters.

2. Top 5 High-Potential Launches
For each product include one short line each:
- **Product name — Category — Short tagline (one line)**  
- **Why it’s high-potential**: 2–3 bullet signals (e.g., rapid upvote velocity; high-quality comments; notable makers; strong social traction; early press; clear PMF).
- **Immediate user value**: 1 short sentence describing the core customer benefit.
- **Suggested next action**: 1 short sentence for me (e.g., test user, follow maker, set Google Alert, consider partnership).
- Include the product URL.

3. Notable Mentions (5–10 products)
- Quick bullets: Product name — 1-line summary — 1 reason worth watching — URL.

4. Emerging Trends & Patterns
- 3–5 concise trend observations seen across launches (e.g., "Retail media tools rising"; "AI-first UX patterns").
- For each trend include 1 short implication for builders/marketers.

5. Signal Decoder (how I judge ‘high-potential’)
- Short checklist of signals used today and what each means in plain language (e.g., “Upvote velocity” — rapid early upvotes indicating community interest).

6. Filters & Customization applied
- State which categories, regions, or keywords were prioritized today (default: All categories; optionally filter: AI, Productivity, Developer Tools, Marketing, Hong Kong / Asia).
- If none specified, note default behavior.

7. Jargon Decoder
- Define any technical or community terms used (upvote velocity, hunter, maker, PMF, launch velocity) in 1 short line each.

8. Strategic Insights & “Ah-ha” Takeaways
- 3 short, original insights from today’s set that feel non-obvious and actionable (insider-style reasoning).

9. Questions & Follow-ups
- 5 suggested questions or actions to dig deeper (e.g., “Which makers have repeat successful launches?”; “Which product solves a quantifiable pain with clear monetization?”).

Formatting, tone and delivery:
- Use header-style section labels exactly as listed.
- Use short bullets and 1–2 sentence micro-paragraphs; keep each item skimmable.
- Prioritize specificity and practical next steps over generic summaries.
- Include product URLs for every product cited.
- End with one recommended product to explore in depth today and why.

Task cadence and output language:
- Run: Daily (once per day) and deliver as a single concise briefing.
- Output language: English

Optional filters (include when setting the Task):
- Categories to prioritize: [e.g., AI, Productivity, Developer Tools, Marketing]  
- Region focus: [e.g., Global, Hong Kong, Asia]  
- Minimum signal thresholds (optional): upvote count, comment count, social shares.
